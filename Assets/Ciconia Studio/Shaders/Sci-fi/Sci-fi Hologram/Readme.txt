Readme - Hologram Shader
_________________________



     
     - Main Properties -

Control the color and the normal appearance.


     - Light Properties - 

Make the shader only affected by spot or point lights. Contol the light intensity directly in the shader and keep the light scene consistent. 
Control the light flickering and the intensity factor (the value need to be >1)  

     - First Line Properties -

Control the numbers, speed, intensity and contrast of the lines.


     - Secondary Line Properties - 

Control the numbers, speed, intensity and contrast of a thinner type of lines


     - Alpha Line Properties -

Control the numbers, speed, intensity of transparent lines. 
With the noise amount you can pixelize theses lines. This will give extra details at close hand.


     - Transparency Properties -

Transparent lines can have bad looking on some areas depending on your models. Fading the upper and bottom normals will make this normals
transparent. If this properties doesn't solve the distortion, better disable Alpha Line Properties this time.

The fresnel property, in some ways, will allow you to round the angles.


     - Dissolve Properties -

Control hologram appearance in all axis. If Local Axis is disable the line is set to world axis. If Dissolve Y ans Z Axis are disable the X Axis is enable.


     - Texture Distortion Properties -

Simulate textures interferences and get control on the distortion level, flickering amount and blur intensity. You can choose to mask this by lines. You can
Control the offset, the numbers, the speed and the contrast of the lines.    

  
     - Vertex Distortion Properties -

This properties affect the vertex, so make sure your model have enough polygones. You can choose to anim the distortion in the Unity animation editor by changing 
the distortion axis values. Use a black and white map to add more randomness.
Or you can enable Random Anim and let the shader do the job.
Delay will affect the time between each distortion. But will also affect how long the dstortion will be active.

This distortion are also masked by lines. You can control the offset, the numbers, and the speed.
